Restrict access to WordPress frontend pages.

# Usage

Copy `access-cookie.php` to the MU plugin folder.

Set the code word which may also be a user name

- by a constant: `O1_ACCESS_COOKIE_USER`
- by an environment variable: `ACCESS_COOKIE_USER`
- by a filter: `access_cookie_user`
- by an option: `access_cookie_user`

Access Cookie activates automatically.
You need to enter this code word in the lost password form.
Then you get a cookie.
Only users with this cookie will be able to access frontend pages generated by WordPress.
Even logged in users will need to get this cookie every 24 hours.

All visitors without this cookie will be redirected to `/website-under-construction.html`

Providing the code word is also a username,
a lost pasword email will be sent to the user's email address.
That user does not need any roles on the site.
